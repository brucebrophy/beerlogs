The characteristic higher color and balanced sweet, malty flavor results in this malt being one of the most popular and distinctive malt styles. Crisp Malting Group  Ale Malt is suited to infusion mashing and top fermentation which typifies traditional ale brewing, but is also very well suited for ale brewing using more modern techniques",

Careful control of kilning ensures the required low color is achieved. Europils malt has a higher protein content which ensures ample enzymatic capability which, combined with the high levels of free amino nitrogen present, assure excellent brewing performance even when un-malted adjuncts form part of the grist composition.",

Due to the kilning regime that this malt goes through, the wort produced is higher in dextrin content than pale malt, resulting in a slightly sweeter, more full-bodied finished beer. The flavor of Mild malt is often described as nutty, and for this reason it is the perfect base malt for many rich British style ales. It is typically used in mild ales, brown ales, Belgian ales and barleywines. Because of the higher dextrine content, Mild malt will contribute more body and mouthfeel than standard pale base malts.",

It works  as a base in British and American style ales, but can be used as part or all of the base for other beers as well, since it is easy to work with and has a great flavor. Pale malt is generally more highly kilned than standard 2-row malt, and as a result it is slightly bready and has a richer flavor profile than 2-row. This is a good base to use in a number of beer styles, from lighter pale ales and bitters to darker porters and stouts. Give this a try next time you are putting together a beer that requires a clean yet slightly rich flavor profile.",

It will increase residual sweetness as well as improving foam stability, increasing body and adding wonderful aromatics to beer. It can be used whenever crystal malt is called for, and while it creates wonderful British style beers, it also works extremely well in just about any beer style. It is commonly used in pale ales, IPAs, bitter, milds, stouts, porters, and other styles as well. A highly recommended crystal malt with excellent flavor and aromatic qualities.",

A bit more will add roast character and may help balance some crystal and caramel flavors contributed by other specialty malts. While it is sometimes described as bitter and astringent, Black Patent malt can also lend deep, rich fruit notes of currant and plum when balanced with other crystal and specialty malts. Black Patent can also contribute dryness to beer. Used mostly in porters and stouts, Black Patent malt may also be used in very small amounts for color adjustment in recipes.",

It contributes a mild golden color to wort and a robust malty-sweet flavor with notes of bread, biscuit, toffee, and caramel. Wheat malts are high in protein, which helps produce fuller-bodied beers. Wheat malt can also improve head formation and retention, depending upon the other grist constituents. In top-fermented beers, Weyermann® Dark Wheat malt performs especially well, adding creaminess, body, and complex wheat flavors. Weyermann® Dark Wheat malt has a somewhat 'drier', more complex character than pale wheat malts. It's the signature malt for Bavarian Dunkelweizen, and perfect for Weizenbocks, Kölsch, and Altbiers.",
