If soured before kettle boil,  boil with hop additions as usual.  If soured after kettle boil cool wort and pitch yeast.  II)  “Co-Pitch”:  Pitch GB110 into a primary with yeast of your choice at 68-72 F.  Wort that is less than 1050 and 7 IBU will typically be very sour in 2-3 weeks.    III)  “Secondary”:  Pitch GB110 after primary fermentation for an aged sour.  Souring by this method typically requires several months.

Maximum levels of sourness should develop within 48 hours. There is no need to hold the temperatures at the high end of the range for effective souring due to the efficient action of plantarum at lower temperatures. When desired sourness is achieved, re-boil wort to kill lactobacillus.  Add hops at this time if desired.  This blend is extremely hop sensitive.  Souring may not occur in worts with 2 or more IBUs.

It exhibits everything you want in a great Pilsner yeast: it's a clean fermenter with relatively low ester formation, exhibits a short lag time, ferments wort quickly and attenuates well, even at the low end of the temperature range. These characteristics allow the malt and hop profile to really shine, and creates a crisp finished beer. We recommend a brief diacetyl rest at ~ 60-65 ºF (2-3 days) at the end of primary fermentation. An extended lagering phase at 33-35 ºF will encourage the yeast to settle and create a clean profile."
