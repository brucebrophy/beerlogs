It was considered a major crop in the 1930’s in both Styria, a state in Austria and across the Savinja river in Slovenia (former Yugoslavia). Its staying power has been attributed to its disease resistance, specifically, its resistance to mildew. It is now world-renowned hop and in high demand. From a brewer’s perspective, Styrian Golding is a lovely aroma hop and exhibits resinous, earthy flavors that are perhaps considered slightly more refined than Fuggle",

Instead, the US varietal is more likely a Fuggle open pollinated with Tettnang Tettnanger. The original import was from a region in Switzerland directly across Lake Constance from Tettnang, Germany. American Tettnanger enjoyed some great popularity early on, being grown in Idaho, Washington and Oregon. It has noble hops aroma qualities with a bouquet of floral spice. However, in recent years, Anheuser Busch abandoned the variety. It is said that US Tettnanger is a good hop for the boil as well as dry hopping whereas the original German variety is better used as a late addition.",
